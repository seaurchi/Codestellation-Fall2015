# About Codestellation

Codestellation is a hackathon at Brandeis University organized by BITMAP, Brandeis' computer science club. We believe what makes Codestellation great and sets it apart from other hackathons is its focus on collaboration and learning. We seek to foster an inclusive environment that values creativity, dedication, and teamwork - not one that values being the most hardcore hacker.
