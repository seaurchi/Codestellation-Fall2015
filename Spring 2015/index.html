                  <h3>A Hacka-what?</h3>
                    <p>A hackathon is an opportunity to get together with awesome people who share your passion for building things and spending a weekend creating something great. That app you've been talking about making for forever? This is the perfect opportunity to sit down and get coding. At Codestellation, you'll become a space cadet and build a team of 3 to 4 other people to create something awesome over the course of 24 hours. In the event that you may have a problem with your code or any questions, there will be plenty of mentors and friendly faces that are eager to help. Along the way, we've got a bunch of cool activities planned just in case you need a break from all the hard work you've been doing. If a weekend of making new friends, coding, and partaking in all sorts of fun activities sounds like a blast to you, join us for Codestellation 2015!</p>

                <h3>When is this happening?</h3>
                  <p>Strap in with us <u>March 27-28</u> as approximately 200 cadets embark on a trek unlike any other, filled with coding, cool people, and more coding. We'll start registration at <u>6 PM on Friday</u> and the quest will conclude by 10 PM on Saturday.</p>
                <h3>where is this happening?</h3>
                <p>Codestellation will take place at <u>Brandeis University</u> in the Olin-Sang Academic Complex. We'll be sending out detailed directions in an email to participants closer to the event date. Unfortunately, as this is Codestellation's first year, we won't be able to provide transportation reimbursements. However, Brandeis is right on the Boston commuter rail, making transportation from other Boston schools extremely easy.

                  <h3>Who can attend?</h3>
                      <p>Any college student older than 18 is invited on this mission. We want to fill our spaceship with a diverse group of interesting hackers with a variety of different skills, attributes, and perspectives - after all, you don't have to be a 1337 hax0r to create something awesome! Don't got a team? We can help you find one! Just indicate on the sign-up form that you would like to be introduced to some cool cats with similar goals. New hackers are encouraged to attend; if you've been waiting for a sign to tell you that you're "good enough" to go to a hackathon, this is it!</p>

                  <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                  <p>You'll definitely need to bring a laptop or some other device to code on. As this is an overnight hackathon, you might thank yourself in the morning if you bring a toothbrush and a towel to wash your face. If this is your first time hacking, consider bringing a pillow and a sleeping bag - it makes a world of a difference to be coding when you're well-rested and energized. Other than the basic necessities, we've got you covered: we'll be providing you with all the food and snacks you could eat, a super rad Codestellation t-shirt, and some hardware if that's what you're planning on working on.

                    <h3>For non-Brandeis students:</h3>
                  <p>The easiest way to get to Brandeis from Boston is through the commuter rail. Take the Fitchburg line from North Station or Porter to Brandeis/Roberts. Once off the train, head north on South St. (uphill). Codestellation is taking place at the Olin Sang Civilization Center and Mandel Center for the Humanities - if you're on campus and you see the world's largest steps, you're there! Get to the top of the staircase and Olin Sang is the building on your left.
